Abstract: The <code>picture</code> element is intended to give authors a way to control which image resource a user agent presents to a user, based on media query and/or support for a particular image format.
Abstract: The primary purpose of the <code>picture</code> element is to address use cases [[!respimg-usecases]] that are left unaddressed by the <code>srcset</code> attribute [[HTML]]; the most important being <a>art direction</a>. Other use cases, such as <q><a href= "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#matching-media-features-and-media-types"> matching media features and media types</a></q> and matching on supported <q><a href= "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#image-formats">image formats</a></q>, are also addressed by this specification.

Introduction</h2>

	This specification provides developers with a means to declare multiple versions of an image at different resolutions,
	and, through [[!MEDIAQ]] (<cite>CSS Media Queries</cite>),
	a means to create specialized presentations of an image and control when they are presented to a user.
	This is achieved by introducing the <a element>picture</a> element to HTML,
	and by enhancing the <a element>source</a> element to support specifying multiple source urls.
	Through this, an <a element>img</a> element

	By relying on [[!MEDIAQ]], a user agent can <em>respond</em> to changes in the browsing environment
	by selecting the image source that most closely matches the browsing environment &ndash;
	thus embodying a technique known as <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a> directly in the HTML markup.
	<a>Media features</a> that a user agent can potentially respond to include, but are not limited to,
	pixel widths and heights,
	and pixel densities,
	as well as environmental lighting conditions, changes in orientation,
	and changes in media type such as going from screen to print.

	The <a element>picture</a> element remains backwards compatible with legacy user agents
	by degrading gracefully through <a>fallback content</a>
	(i.e., through the <a element>img</a> element)
	while also potentially providing better accessibility than the existing <a element>img</a> element.

	This specification also defines the <a interface>HTMLPictureElement</a> interface,
	through which developers can interact with <a element>picture</a> elements.


<h3 id='when-to-use'>
When to use <code>picture</code></h3>

	The <a element>picture</a> element should be used when an image source exists in multiple densities,
	or when a responsive design dictates a somewhat different image on some types of screens (“art direction”).

	The <a element>picture</a> element is not a general replacement for the <a element>img</a> element.
	When there is only a single image source,
	authors should just use the <a element>img</a> element as usual,
	rather than cluttering their page with additional unnecessary syntax.


<h3 id='examples'>
Examples of usage</h3>

	<div class='example'>
		This example shows a basic usage of the <a element>picture</a> element
		to present the same image at multiple resolutions.

		<pre>
			&lt;picture>
				&lt;source srcset="pic1x.jpg 1x, pic2x.jpg 2x, pic4x.jpg 4x">
				&lt;img alt="A rad wolf." src="pic1x.jpg">
			&lt;/picture>
		</pre>

		In this example, the user agent will choose one of the three URLs--
		“pic1x.jpg”, “pic2x.jpg”, or “pic4x.jpg”--
		depending on whether the quality of the user’s screen
		and perhaps other factors,
		such as the user’s bandwidth.

		It will then load the chosen URL in the <a element>img</a> child,
		as if it were specified in the <a element>img</a> element’s own <a element-attr for="img">src</a> attribute.

		For backwards compatibility with older user agents that don't yet understand the <a element>picture</a> element,
		one of the URLs is duplicated in the <a element>img</a> element’s <a element-attr>src</a> attribute.
		This is ignored in modern user agents,
		but will result in something useful
		(though perhaps lower-resolution than the user would like)
		being displayed even in older user agents.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		When doing responsive design,
		it is sometimes necessary to produce slightly different versions of an image
		depending on the user's device.
		For example,
		on a small screen like a phone,
		the author might want to show a zoomed-in crop of an image,
		while on a larger screen the full image can be displayed instead.
		This can be accomplished with multiple <a element>source</a> elements:

		<pre>
			&lt;picture>
				 &lt;source media="(min-width: 45em)" srcset="large.jpg">
				 &lt;source media="(min-width: 18em)" srcset="med.jpg">
				 &lt;img src="small.jpg" alt="The president giving an award." width="500" height="500">
			&lt;/picture>
		</pre>

		In this example, depending on the user’s screen size,
		one of the URLs will be downloaded.
		For example, on a large desktop screen “large.jpg” will be displayed in the <a element>img</a> element.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		Of course, one can use both multiple <a element>source</a> elements
		<em>and</em> multiple sources within a single <a element>source</a> element together:

		<pre>
			&lt;picture>
				 &lt;source media="(min-width: 45em)" srcset="large-1.jpg, large-2.jpg 2x">
				 &lt;source media="(min-width: 18em)" srcset="med-1.jpg, med-2.jpg 2x">
				 &lt;source srcset="small-1.jpg, small-2.jpg 2x">
				 &lt;img src="small-1.jpg" alt="The president giving an award." width="500" height="500">
			&lt;/picture>
		</pre>

		In this example,
		the user agent first chooses which set of sources to look at,
		depending on the size of the user’s screen.
		Then it chooses which of the different-density sources to load,
		based on information it knows about the user’s device.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		If the final size of the <a element>img</a> element isn’t known ahead of time,
		it can be difficult or impossible to specify a density descriptor for the image sources.
		For example,
		if an image is meant to take up the full width of the user’s screen,
		an image that is 600 image pixels wide will be approximately ''2x'' on a small ''320px''-wide phone,
		approximately ''1x'' on a larger tablet display,
		and less than ''1x'' on a large desktop monitor.

		To help with this,
		rather than specifying the densities of each image source,
		the sizes of each image source can be specified directly,
		along with the size of the <a element>img</a> element.
		The user agent will then automatically calculate the effective pixel density of the image
		and choose which one to download accordingly.

		<pre>
			&lt;picture>
				&lt;source sizes="100%" srcset="pic400.jpg 400w, pic800.jpg 800w, pic1600.jpg 1600w">
				&lt;img src="pic400.jpg" alt="The president giving an award.">
			&lt;/picture>
		</pre>

		In this example, the image source is provided at three sizes--
		400 pixels wide, 800 pixels wide, and 1600 pixels wide.
		As well, it declares that the <a element>img</a> element is intrinsically sized to be as wide as the entire viewport.
		If the user's device is ''320px'' wide,
		this is equivalent to specifying ''pic400.jpg 1.25x, pic800.jpg 2.5x, pic1600.jpg 5x''.
		On the other hand,
		if the user's device is ''1200px'' wide,
		this is equivalent to specifying ''pic400.jpg .33x, pic800.jpg .67x, pic1600.jpg 1.33x''.

		With this information,
		the user agent can choose the correct image source to download
		regardless of how large the user's device is.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		The previous example showed how to deal with the <a element>img</a> element’s size being unpredictable
		because it was a fraction of the viewport’s size.
		Sometimes, though, the size of an image can also change based on a site’s layout breakpoints.

		For example, say your site had three basic layouts:

		<figure>
			<img src="images/viewport_selection_mob_first.jpg">
			<figcaption>
				Single-column (100%) on small screens,
				two-column (50%) on medium screens,
				and three-column (approximately 33%) on large screens.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		Assuming that the same image is supposed to be used at all of these layouts
		(that is, you aren't doing <a>art direction</a> cropping to optimize the display of the image for a given size),
		then all of these cases can be addressed by a handful of images at various sizes.
		In that case, the following code specifies the image's display:

		<pre>
			&lt;picture>
				&lt;source sizes="(max-width: 30em) 100%, (max-width: 50em) 50%, calc(33% - 100px)"
								srcset="pic100.jpg 100w, pic200.jpg 200w, pic400.jpg 400w,
												pic800.jpg 800w, pic1600.jpg 1600w, pic3200.jpg 3200w">
				&lt;img src="pic400.jpg" alt="The president giving an award.">
			&lt;/picture>
		</pre>

		The <a element-attr for="source">sizes</a> attribute sets up the layout breakpoints at ''30em'' and ''50em'',
		and declares the image sizes between these breakpoints to be ''100%'', ''50%'', or ''calc(33% - 100px)''.

		The six image sources provided automatically cover every reasonable possibility.
		For small screens (phone size, or even smaller, like watches),
		anything from the 100 pixel wide image to the 800 pixel wide image may be downloaded,
		depending on screen size and density.
		For medium and large screens,
		anything from the 400 pixel wide image and up may be chosen.
		The author doesn't have to do any math or complex figuring,
		just provide the image in enough sizes to cover everything they believe reasonable.

		Specifying this information with multiple <a element>source</a> elements,
		one for each of the <a>media queries</a>,
		is possible, but much more verbose,
		as the <a element-attr for="source">srcset</a> attributes have to be duplicated for each of them.
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		This example shows how picture and other HTML elements can be used
		together.

		<pre>
			&lt;figure>
					&lt;picture>
						 &lt;source media="(min-width: 45em)" srcset="large-1.jpg, large-2.jpg 2x">
						 &lt;source media="(min-width: 18em)" srcset="med-1.jpg, med-2.jpg 2x">
						 &lt;source srcset="small-1.jpg, small-2.jpg 2x">
						 &lt;img src="small-1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200">
					&lt;/picture>
					&lt;figcaption>A figure of a fox jumping over a lazy box.&lt;/figcaption>
			&lt;/figure>
		</pre>
	</div>


<h3 id='relationship-to-srcset'>
Relationship to <code>srcset</code></h3>

	The <code>srcset</code> attribute allows authors to define various
	image resources and “hints” that assist a user agent in determining
	the most appropriate image source to display. Given a set of image
	resources, the user agent has the option of either following or
	overriding the author’s declarations to optimize the user experience
	based on criteria such as <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#device-pixel-ratio-based-selection">
	display density</a>, network connection type, user preferences, and
	so on.

	The <code>picture</code> element defines conditions under which the
	user agent needs to follow the author's explicit instructions when
	selecting which resource to display. This includes image sources with
	inherent sizes designed to align with layout variations specified in
	CSS media queries (see: <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#design-breakpoints">design
	breakpoints</a>, and <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#relative-units">relative
	units</a>) or content variations for increased clarity and focus
	(i.e., <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction"><q>art
	direction</q></a>) based on the client’s viewport.

	The proposed solutions are not mutually exclusive. They work together
	to address the complete set of <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/">use cases and requirements
	for responsive images</a> (see [[!respimg-usecases]]).

	Furthermore, this specification <a href="#parse-srcset-attr">extends the <code>srcset</code> attribute </a> to adequately address the <a href=
	"http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#h3_viewport-based-selection">
	viewport based selection</a> use case.

<h2 id='defs'>
Definitions</h2>

	The following terms are used throughout this specification so they are
	gathered here for the readers convenience. The following list of terms
	is not exhaustive; other terms are defined throughout this
	specification.

	The follow terms are defined by the [[!HTML]] specification:
	<dfn id="dfn-fallback-content"><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#fallback-content">fallback content</a></dfn>,
	and <dfn id="dfn-valid-media-query"><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#valid-media-query">valid media query</a></dfn>.


<h2 id='the-picture-element'>
The <a element>picture</a> Element</h2>

	<pre class='elementdef'>
	Name: <dfn element>picture</dfn>
	Categories: Flow content, Phrasing content, Embedded content, Palpable content
	Contexts: Where embedded content is expected
	Content Model: Zero or more <a element>source</a> elements, followed by one <a element>img</a> element.
	Attributes: Global attributes
	</pre>

	The <a element>picture</a> element is a container which provides multiples sources to its contained <a element>img</a> element,
	allowing the displayed image to vary based on the density of the screen
	or other environmental factors expressed as <a>media queries</a>.

	Note: <a element>picture</a> is somewhat different from the similar-looking elements <a element>video</a> and <a element>audio</a>.
	While all of them contain <a element>source</a> elements,
	the <a element-attr for="source">src</a> attribute has no meaning when the element is nested within <a element>picture</a>,
	and the resource selection algorithm is different.
	As well,
	the <a element>picture</a> element itself does not display anything;
	it merely provides a context for its contained <a element>img</a>
	that enables it to choose from multiple source urls.

	A <a element>picture</a> element is associated with a <dfn export>list of source sets</dfn>,
	which is a list of zero or more <a>source sets</a>.

	A <dfn export>source set</dfn> is a set of zero or more <a>image sources</a>,
	optionally a <a>source size list</a>,
	and optionally a <a>media query</a>.

	An <dfn export>image source</dfn> is a URL,
	and optionally either a density descriptor,
	or a width descriptor.

	A <dfn export>source size list</dfn> is a list of zero or more pairs of a <a>media query</a> and a <<length>>,
	and optionally a default <<length>>.

Selecting an Image Source</h4>

	<p class='issue'>
		This is meant to be the HTML integration point.

	When asked to <dfn>select an image source</dfn> for a given <a element>img</a> element <var>el</var> with a <a element>picture</a> element parent <var>parent</var>,
	user agents must do the following:

	<ol>
		<li>

<h4 id='parse-srcset-attr'>
Parsing a <code>srcset</code> Attribute</h4>

	When asked to <dfn title="parse a srcset attribute|parse its srcset attribute">parse a srcset attribute</dfn> from an element,
	parse the value of the element's <code>srcset</code> attribute with the following grammar:

	<pre>
		<dfn>&lt;image-source-list></dfn> = <<image-source>>#
		<dfn>&lt;image-source></dfn> = <<url>> [ <<resolution>> | <<source-width>> ]?
	</pre>

	The above grammar must be interpreted per the grammar definition in [[!CSS3VAL]].
	For the purposes of the above grammar,
	the <dfn noexport>&lt;url></dfn> production is simply any sequence of non-<a>whitespace</a> characters
	that does not end in a comma.
	The <dfn>&lt;source-width></dfn> production is a <a>dimension</a> with a unit of ''w''.
	All other terminal productions are defined as per CSS.

	If the value does not parse successfully according to the above grammar,
	return an empty <a>source set</a>.

	Otherwise,
	let <var>source set</var> initially be an empty <a>source set</a>.
	For each <<image-source>> parsed,
	do the following:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Let <var>source</var> be a fresh <a>image source</a>.

		<li>
			Set <var>source</var>’s URL to the parsed <<url>>.

		<li>
			If a <<resolution>> was parsed,
			set <var>source</var>’s resolution descriptor to the <<resolution>>’s value.

		<li>
			If a <<source-width>> was parsed,
			set <var>source</var>’s width descriptor to the <<source-width>>’s value.

		<li>
			Append <var>source</var> to <var>source set</var>.

	Then return <var>source set</var>.

<h4 id='parse-sizes-attr'>
Parsing a <code>sizes</code> Attribute</h4>

	When asked to <dfn title="parse a sizes attribute|parse its sizes attribute">parse a sizes attribute</dfn> from an element,

	<pre>
		<dfn>&lt;source-size-list></dfn> = <<source-size>>#?
		<dfn>&lt;source-size></dfn> = <<media-query>>? <<length>>
	</pre>

	The above grammar must be interpreted per the grammar definition in [[!CSS3VAL]].

	let <var>source size list</var> initially be an empty <a>source size list</a>.
    Set <var>source size list</var>’s default size to the <var>child</var> <a element>img</a>'s <dfn element-attr for="img">width</dfn> attribute.

	If the value does not parse successfully according to the above grammar,
	return <a>source size list</a>.

	Otherwise, for each <<source-size>> parsed,

<h4 id='normalize-source-densities'>
Normalizing the Source Densities</h4>

	An <a>image source</a> can have a density descriptor,
	a width descriptor,
	or no descriptor at all accompanying its URL.
	Normalizing a <a>source set</a> gives every <a>image source</a> a density descriptor.

	When asked to <dfn>normalize the source densities</dfn> of a <a>source set</a> <var>source set</var>,
	user agents must do the following:

	<ol>
		<li>
			<a>Find the effective size</a> from <var>source set</var>’s <a>source size list</a>,
			and let the result be <var>effective size</var>.

	which is a simplified parser that runs ahead of the main HTML parser
	during the initial load of the page,
	looking for URLs that it can begin loading as quickly as possible.

	The definition of the <a element>picture</a> element is compatible with a preload scanner,
	at least for some <a>media queries</a>.

	If a UA uses a preload scanner,
	it must recognize when a an <a element>img</a> element is a child of a <a element>picture</a>,
	and use the full algorithm to <a>select an image source</a> to determine which URL to pre-load,
	with the following caveats:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The preload scanner must be able to correctly determine the truth value of
			''@media/width'', ''@media/device-width'', ''@media/height'', ''@media/device-height'', and ''@media/resolution'' <a>media features</a>.

		<li>
			The preload scanner may be able to correctly determine the truth value of any other <a>media feature</a>.
			If it encounters an unknown <a>media feature</a>,
			or one which it cannot correctly determine the truth value of,
			it must not attempt to preload <strong>any</strong> URL for the given <a element>img</a> element.
	</ul>

<code>HTMLPictureElement</code> interface</h3>

	<pre class='idl'>
		interface HTMLPictureElement {
		};
	</pre>

	<p class='issue'>
		We could maybe add some more things here,
		like a list of the relevant <a element>source</a> elements
		and the active <a element>img</a> element.
		Readonly?
		I dunno.

Changes to the <a element>source</a> Element</h2>

	The <a element>source</a> element gains <dfn element-attr for="source">srcset</dfn> and <dfn element-attr for="source">sizes</dfn> attributes,
	which contain,
	respectively,
	a list of one or more image sources,
	and a set of intrinsic sizes for those sources.

	The <a element-attr for="source">srcset</a> attribute is reflected by the <a attribute>srcset</a> attribute on the element’s DOM interface.
	The <a element-attr for="source">sizes</a> attribute is reflected by the <a attribute>sizes</a> attribute on the element’s DOM interface.

	<pre class='idl'>
		partial interface HTMLSourceElement {
			attribute DOMString srcset;
			attribute DOMString sizes;
		};
	</pre>
